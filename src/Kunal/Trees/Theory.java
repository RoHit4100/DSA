        size == total number of nodes
        sibling == same parent children
        edge == line between two nodes
        height == max no of edges between nodes(max number of node from that node to the leaf node).
        level == difference between height of that node and root node
               height of node - height of root

        types of binary tree
            complete binary tree,
                all the levels are filled apart from the last level, but last level is filled from left to right
            full binary tree or strict binary tree,
                in this binary tree each node has either 0 or 2 childrens
            perfect binary tree,
                all levels are full
                properties,
                    height = h
                    no of nodes = 2^(h+1) - 1
                    no of leaf nodes = 2^(h)

            height balance tree,
                avg height is O(log n)
            skewed binary tree,
                every node has only one child, LL
            ordered binary tree,
                every node has some property, binary search tree
